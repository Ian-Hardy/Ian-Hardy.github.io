## Welcome

I am a MASc Student studying Computer Science at UC Santa Cruz after a 3 years stint in the fintech world. I am interested in Machine Learning, specifically Interpretability, Robustness, and Fairness in ML systems. I want to help ensure we create provably ethical AI.

I also love topology, statistics, linguistics, mycology, games, and our beautiful forested campus. I make a mean green curry.
