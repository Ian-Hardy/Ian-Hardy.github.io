## About Me

I am a MASc Student studying Computer Science at UC Santa Cruz. Previously I worked in financial technologies, where I designed transparent underwriting systems and created portfolio management tools for mortgage servicers. I am interested in Machine Learning, specifically Interpretability, Robustness, and Fairness in ML systems. I want to help ensure we create provably ethical AI.

I also love topology, statistics, linguistics, mycology, games, and our beautiful forested campus. I make a mean green curry.
